            Duck is the common name for a large number of species in the waterfowl family Anatidae which also includes swans and geese. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and

            Kiwi or kiwis are flightless birds native to New Zealand, in the genus Apteryx and family Apterygidae. Approximately the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far the smallest living ratites (which also consist of ostriches, emus,
            rheas, and cassowaries), and lay the largest egg in relation to their body size of any species of bird in the world.
